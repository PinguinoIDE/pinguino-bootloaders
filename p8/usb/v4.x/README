This code provides a USB Bootloader for 8-bit (c) Microchip microcontrollers
with built-in USB module such as PIC18Fx550, PIC18Fx6J50 or PIC18Fx7J53.

A bootloader is a piece of code that is executed once the system is booted.

Typically, this small program (< 3K) running inside the microcontroller
is responsible for transferring your application from your PC to the
microcontroller memory and handing over the control to this program afterwards.

The code has been written for SDCC (Small Device C Compiler) a freeware
ANSI-C compiler so make sure SDCC and GPUTILS are installed on your computer.
You can get the latest sources by running the build-sdcc-v3.sh script.

To compile the bootloader, first open and edit Makefile to suit your needs
and then type make in a terminal. This project also implements Wiztiti.py,
a graphical frontends using Python.

To load your PIC with the .hex file produced during the build process, you
need a programmer and its interface such as PicKit / MPLABX (www.microchip.com/mplabx)
or Wisp648 / Wisp (www.voti.nl/wisp648/).
 
Once loaded, you should see the led blinking. Your PIC is now in bootloader mode
and wait for your PC to send him your application.

Compile one of the example and load it into your PIC using Pinguino IDE.
You can also use the bootloader without the Pinguino IDE, use then uploader.py
to load your application in the PIC.

Please let me know if you make any change, addition or improvement in
this code.

Thank you.
